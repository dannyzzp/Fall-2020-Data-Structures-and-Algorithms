# Fall-2020-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
These are all the homework assignments from my Data Structures and Algorithms class during studying as an exchange student at the University of Scranton.
Although I took a Data Structures course in Fu Jen Catholic University as a selective course in my junior year, I didn't learn anything from it（no offense）.
But from here, I learned a lot.
